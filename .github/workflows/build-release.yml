    # NOTE: If the 'Create GitHub Release' or 'Upload Release Asset' steps fail with
    # "Error: Resource not accessible by integration", it usually means the default
    # GITHUB_TOKEN does not have sufficient permissions.
    # To resolve this:
    # 1. Check repository settings: Go to Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions.
    #    Ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected for GITHUB_TOKEN.
    # 2. If the issue persists, or for more fine-grained control, create a Personal Access Token (PAT)
    #    with 'repo' (or 'public_repo' for public repos) and 'workflow' scopes.
    #    Store this PAT as a secret in the repository (e.g., `RELEASE_PAT`) and
    #    use it in the `env` block for these steps:
    #    env:
    #      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PAT }}
    #    Remember that using a PAT grants permissions based on the user who created it.
